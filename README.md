The project involves assessing coral reef fish species using a dataset that includes:

- **Fish species density data**: Information about the density of 109 fish species across various survey sites.
- **Environmental data**: Variables that could affect fish density, such as coral cover, reef complexity, sea surface temperature, net primary productivity, wave exposure, habitat types, and anthropogenic factors.
- **Trait data**: Morphological, behavioral, and ecological traits of the fish species, including their response variables associated with relief (structural complexity of reefs) and coral cover.

## Installation
*Python Version: 3.11.7*
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gpealat/coralreef
    ```
2. Change into the project directory
    ```sh
    cd coralreef
    ```
3. (Recommended) If you are using anaconda, create a virtual environment first
    ```sh
    conda create --name coral
    ```
4. (Recommended) Activate the virtual environment
      ```sh
      conda activate coral
      ```
5. Install the required packages
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Run Jupyter
   ```jupyter notebook```

## Usage

Run each of the notebooks in the following order

1. [EDA](https://github.com/gpealat/coralreef/blob/main/Notebooks/1%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
    This notebook provides an initial exploration of the dataset, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and handling missing data.
    Data Cleaning: 2 - Data Cleaning.ipynb
2. [Data cleaning](https://github.com/gpealat/coralreef/blob/main/Notebooks/2%20-%20Data%20cleaning.ipynb)
    In this notebook, the dataset is cleaned by addressing missing values, handling duplicates, and preparing the data for machine learning models.
3. [Regression model](https://github.com/gpealat/coralreef/blob/main/Notebooks/3%20-%20Regression%20model.ipynb)
    This notebook focuses on training regression models to predict the continuous Diversity Index.
4. [Classification model](https:///)
    This notebook tests classification models by categorizing the Diversity Index into bins (e.g., low, medium, high) and predicting these classes.
