The project involves assessing coral reef fish species using a dataset that includes:

- **Fish species density data**: Information about the density of 109 fish species across various survey sites.
- **Environmental data**: Variables that could affect fish density, such as coral cover, reef complexity, sea surface temperature, net primary productivity, wave exposure, habitat types, and anthropogenic factors.
- **Trait data**: Morphological, behavioral, and ecological traits of the fish species, including their response variables associated with relief (structural complexity of reefs) and coral cover.
